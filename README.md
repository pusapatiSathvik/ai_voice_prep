🚀 Workflow: How HireView Works
HireView orchestrates a seamless and intelligent interview preparation experience through the following interconnected steps:

Step 1: User Authentication 🔐
User Action: A user initiates their journey by signing up or logging into the HireView platform.

Flow: Frontend (React App) ➡️ Firebase Authentication

Outcome: Secure management of user credentials, granting access to the application's features.

Step 2: Interview Setup & Question Request 📝
User Action: The user navigates to the interview section. They fill out a form, specifying their desired role, tech stack, difficulty level, and can optionally paste their resume text or a job description.

(Note: PDF resume upload is currently under development and will be integrated soon for enhanced convenience.)

Flow: Frontend (React App) ➡️ Backend (Node.js/Express Server)

Details: All specified form data is securely transmitted to the backend for processing.

Step 3: AI-Powered Question Generation 🧠
Process:

The Backend receives the user's request.

(Future: If a PDF resume is uploaded, the backend will utilize pdf-parse to extract the text content.)

The backend then intelligently constructs a detailed prompt, incorporating the provided resume text (if any), job description (if any), and the desired role.

Flow: Backend ➡️ Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash)

Outcome: The Google Gemini API processes this comprehensive prompt and generates a set of highly tailored interview questions designed specifically for the user's profile and target role.

Step 4: Questions Delivery & Voice Agent Initialization 🎤
Process:

The Backend receives the generated questions from Google Gemini.

These questions are then persisted in Firebase Firestore, creating a historical record for the user's interview sessions.

Crucially, the questions are simultaneously sent to the Vapi.ai service (via your backend) to pre-load and initialize the voice agent with the complete interview script.

Flow: Google Gemini API ➡️ Backend ➡️ Firebase Firestore (for storage) & Vapi.ai (for voice agent setup)

Step 5: Interactive Voice Interview Session 🗣️
Process:

The React Frontend establishes a voice connection with Vapi.ai.

Vapi.ai takes on the role of the AI interviewer, articulately asking the pre-loaded questions in a natural, human-like voice.

The user provides their answers verbally into their microphone.

Vapi.ai handles real-time speech-to-text conversion and intelligently manages the conversational flow, ensuring a highly interactive and realistic practice experience.

Flow: Frontend (React App) ↔️ Vapi.ai Voice Agent

Step 6: Interview Conclusion & Transcript Submission 📄
Process: Upon the conclusion of the interview session (e.g., all questions answered, time limit reached), Vapi.ai compiles and provides a complete, accurate transcript of the entire conversation (encompassing both the AI's questions and the user's spoken answers).

Flow: Vapi.ai Voice Agent ➡️ Backend (Node.js/Express Server)

Step 7: AI-Powered Feedback Generation & Storage 📈
Process:

The Backend receives the comprehensive interview transcript.

The backend constructs a new, targeted prompt, sending the transcript to the Google Gemini API with precise instructions to generate in-depth feedback on the user's performance (covering content accuracy, technical depth, communication skills, and more).

Google Gemini API processes the transcript and returns a detailed feedback report.

The Backend receives this valuable feedback and stores it securely in Firebase Firestore, meticulously linking it to the specific interview session for future review.

Flow: Backend ➡️ Google Gemini API ➡️ Firebase Firestore (for storage)

Step 8: Feedback Display & Review 📊
Process: Finally, the Backend transmits the generated feedback report back to the React Frontend.

User Action: The user can then access and meticulously review their detailed performance report directly within the HireView application. This report includes clear insights into their strengths, identified weaknesses, and actionable advice for continuous improvement.

Flow: Backend ➡️ Frontend (React App)

This intricate dance between the Frontend, Backend, Firebase, Google Gemini, and Vapi.ai culminates in a powerful, personalized, and highly effective interview preparation tool.
